// Certainly! Here's a problem statement related to attendance tracking for a delivery company:

// ---

// *Problem Statement: Maximum Attendance*

// A delivery company wants to track the attendance of its agents. Each agent marks their attendance in a portal, and the company provides incentives based on attendance. If an agent's attendance is more than 80%, they receive an incentive; otherwise, they do not.

// Write a program that allows the user to input the following details:
// - The number of employees (agents) in the company.
// - The total number of working days in the month.

// For each employee, prompt the user to mark their attendance for each day (either present or absent). Calculate the attendance percentage for each employee and determine whether they qualify for the incentive.

// *Input:*
// - Number of employees (N) (1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 1000)
// - Number of working days in the month (D) (1 â‰¤ D â‰¤ 31)

// *Output:*
// For each employee, print whether they qualify for the incentive based on their attendance percentage. If the attendance is greater than 80%, print "Qualifies for incentive," otherwise print "Does not qualify for incentive."

// Feel free to use this problem statement as a starting point for your coding practice! ðŸ˜Š


// Input:
// Number of employees: 5
// Number of working days: 25
// Employee 1 attendance (days present): 22
// Employee 2 attendance (days present): 20
// Employee 3 attendance (days present): 24
// Employee 4 attendance (days present): 18
// Employee 5 attendance (days present): 23

// Output:
// Employee 1 qualifies for the incentive. Attendance: 88.00%
// Employee 2 qualifies for the incentive. Attendance: 80.00%
// Employee 3 qualifies for the incentive. Attendance: 96.00%
// Employee 4 does not qualify for the incentive. Attendance: 72.00%
// Employee 5 qualifies for the incentive. Attendance: 92.00%
